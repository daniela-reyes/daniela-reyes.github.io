<h1>Week 2:</h1>
<p>Jun 21, 2015</p>

<p>On my last entry, I mention I expected my only challenge to be understanding how to use Travis CI. However, now that the first project is over I feel that the challenge was getting my mind to work in Python. I'm so used to Java and C that I found myself constantly making small mistakes.  For  example, my most common mistakes were using a ';' at the end of each statements, not doing the indentation correctly or using tab rather than space. This made debugging rather tedious and a great waste of time. However, the overall project was fairly simple. It didn't take much time to create the cache and to get accepted by Sphere Online Judge. </p>

<p>During this week, Professor Downing reviewed operators in Python and JavaScript. As well as the second project, which is due this upcomming Tuesday. Even though debugging is tedious Python is a pretty interesting language. It really makes you change your mind set, and explore different possibilities. Such as floor and true division which really caught my attention. It just seems a little bit odd having two ways of making a division, but I guess they can be useful when having to get specific resutls.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure how I feel about the next project. It looks like it's going to be harder than the first one. Specially because we have less time to work on it. Thankfully we are allowed to work with a partner this time. Hopefully that will be helpful in order to finish the project on time. Also Aseal has changed the study session for the upcomming Monday instead of Tuesday, which provides us more time to be able to fix any bugs before submition. </p>
