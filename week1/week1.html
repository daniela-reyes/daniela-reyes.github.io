<h1>Week 1</h1>

The first week was interesting. We did accomplish quite a lot of things. We got used to git and all the usual things that comes with it. Downing is a very interesting professor and I'm still trying to get used to his draconian rules. I like it a lot because we know exactly what we're being graded on unlike those classes where one is not really sure what to do.<br><br>

I found unit tests to be very useful. Although I don't usually write them, I see the benefit in unit tests and the importance of it as mentioned in class by the Professor. We learned how naked asserts aren't usually used but a wrapper assert in our case unittest for python because we usually want to see not only which one we failed but if we failed any of the other asserts. <br><br>


Python is still relatively new to me so far but I'm getting used to. Collatz is a very interesting project and it's a great start to getting used to git as a management tool. Although like Downing said it is indeed overkill for Collatz itself, I found that I learned a huge amount of material. He also loves calling on people and I find it very beneficial because it keeps you on your toes and ready whenever. As of now, I found that paying attention in class and writing notes down as he speaks and reviewing them after really does help you prepare so far.<br><br>

I also like how Professor Downing is using examples in both javascript and python, especially for the unit testings. It gives a different viewpoint of both languages and how there are different implementations for the same job both which have pros and cons.

<br><br>

I look forward to this class and what it has to offer!
