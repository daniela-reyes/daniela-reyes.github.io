<h1>Week 2:</h1>
<p>Jun 28, 2015</p>

<p>This week made me realize that I need more hours in a day. I wasn't able to go over all the lectures from last week as I had done for the weeks before,
and I'm pretty sure it reflected on this week's quizzes. However, I'm really glad that my partner and I were able to finish the project. We definitely 
didn't have much time to work on it compared to the last one, but it was still pretty straightforward. At first we tried creating our own cache but we kept 
running into problems. So at the end we opted to use the ones that were already made. </p>

<p>We got our first guest speaker this week from Rackspace. During his presentation he went over how to use a server, which would be useful for the upcoming 
project. I enjoy this kind of presentation because even though he talked about his company at the end most of his presentation was about a specific software
or activity. I feel that a lot of guest speakers tend to say the same things. The company is amazing, they have a lot of diversity, everyone helps each other,
the environment in great, and at the end they always have the same advise: check your resume, get an internship, go to conferences or other CS related events,
etc. Each company is great in their own way and may have some unique aspects which are worth learning about. However, in my point of view all those presentations 
tend to collide at some point. I'm glad this one was different and that we are able to use it as part of this course. </p>

<p>Tip of the week:</p>

<p> Work smarter not harder.

Thank you to all the students that created a cache for the second project. It was really useful and saved us a lot of time</p>
