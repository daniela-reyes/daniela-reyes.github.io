<h1>Week 4:</h1>
<p>Jul 5, 2015</p>

<p>I really need to set up a reminder for this entries. They are not a requirement so I'm 
constantly forgetting that I have to write them. However I'm not sure if we are eligible to 
receive points if we miss one or two. I want to assume that we need all nine to be able to
receive any form of extra credit. That aside, our fourth week was pretty short, it only consisted 
of two days. Monday we had our first test. It wasn't that bad. I'm sure I would have gotten a 
better grade if I had studied a little bit more.</p>

<p>During Wednesday's lecture we had some time to create groups for the next project. The third 
project deals with creating a web app that is divided into three different phases. The first 
phase is due this upcoming Tuesday. Our group is making the project based on different animal 
shelters around Austin. I usually don't like working in teams but I have to admit my team is
pretty awesome. They are reliable and great when working in a team. I don't feel left out or 
as if I have to pick up the work from someone else. I think our group has created a pretty calm
environment so I have more confidence when asking for help or clarification. Right now I'm one
of the persons working on implementing the frontend. I had never used JavaScript 
or AngularJs before but after having some time to play around with it, they appears to be straightforward.
So far, I'm enjoying this project. </p>

<p>Tip-of-the-week:</p>

<p> I know this is pretty simple but while working on this project I found http://www.w3schools.com/ to be 
rather useful. Like I said above I don't have much experience with JavaScript or AngularJS and this website
has small demos or exercises that let you play with one specific aspect. </p>
