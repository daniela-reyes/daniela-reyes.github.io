<h1>Week 1:</h1>
<p>Jun 14, 2015</p>

<p>The first week of class is finally over. So far we had been assigned our first project, which is based on the Collatz conjecture. It is a pretty simple assignment, however, the challenge would be understanding how to use Travis CI. This is a challenge to me because I had never used the Travis CI. before, and even after the explanation during class I still feel I do not understand it a 100%. To be honest, I do not know how Professor Downing finds this tools. Up to this point, none of my professor have ask me to use Travis Cl, coverage or even unit tests before. Therefore, I'm really looking forward on learning how to use them. In fact as I write this entry I'm trying to figure out how to use GitHub Pages. Last time I had to make a blog I used Blogger so I'm not really familiarize with this tool.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel the class is going to be highly entertaining and probably going to move at a fast pace. Also, I'm glad it's a nine weeks course, because I doubt we could properly cover all the material in just the first summer session. Also not having class on Tuesday and Thursday is really convenient in order to be able to catch up and study for the upcoming quiz. </p>

<p>I'm looking forward for the final project. However, I'm also a little nervous about working in groups. Even though I understand the objective I rather work in pairs than groups. It seems to always be a problem with people not showing up, not doing its part or not accepting other's people opinion and ideas.  </p>

<p>Tip-of-the-Week: When learning a new language I always like solving some of the problems listed in https://projecteuler.net/archives. They are simple and help you practice as much as possible. </p>
