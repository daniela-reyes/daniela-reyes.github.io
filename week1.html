<h1>Week 1</h1>

The first week of class is finally over. So far we had been assigned our first project. It is based on the Collatz conjecture. It is a pretty simple assignment, the only real challenge would be understanding how to use Travis CI. I had never used it before, and even after the explanation during class I don't think I understand it a 100%. To be honest I don't know how Professor Downing finds this tools. I haven't had any other professor use Travis Cl, coverage or even unit tests before. However I'm really looking forward on learning how to use them. In fact as I write this entry I'm trying to figure out how to use GitHub Pages. Last time I had to make a blog I used Blogger so I'm not really familiarize with this tool.

Overall I feel the class is going to be really interesting and probably going to be moving at a fast pace. I'm glad it is a nine weeks course, I doubt we would had been able to properly cover all the material in just the first summer session. Also not having class on Tuesday and Thursday is really convenient in order to be able to catch up and study for the upcoming quiz. 

I'm looking forward for the final project. However I'm also a little nervous about working in groups. Even though I understand the objective I rather work in pairs than groups. There always seems to be a problem with people not showing up, not doing its part or not accepting other's people opinion and ideas.  

Tip of the Week: When learning a new language I always like solving some of the problems listed in https://projecteuler.net/archives. They are simple and help you practice as much as possible.
