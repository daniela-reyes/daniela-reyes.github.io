<h3>Week 7: </h3> <h4>Jul 26 2015</h4>
<p>It's sad to realize that this class is coming to an end. However I'm glad I don't have more projects 
keeping me at GDC unil 6 am. This is a though class, but it is totally worth it. Even though you have 
a shorter amount of time during the summer you still get to learn a lot of different tools.I now have a 
much better understanding of Python, Javascript, HTML, AngularJs and JQuery. </p>

<p>I will definitely take another class with Professor Downing. He is knowledgeable on the material and 
really patient when answering questions. However I still don't like the daily quizzes. They make sure to 
test the cases that are completely different to the other ones. They are pretty tricky and you have to make 
sure to know the material. So studying 15 min before class is not a good idea, which sadly it was sometimes
all the time I had.</p>

<p>My favorite part of this class was probably the last project. Even though it consumed most of my time
it was really interesting. I learn a lot when working on it, and it also gave me several ideas for some
personal projects. Our web ended up looking pretty good. However I think it would had been nice to had 
an extra day just to fix small details and make sure the website look better. </p>

<p>Tip-of-the-week: <br>

One of my partners for the last project found a Firefox's tool call Style Editor. It lets you “view and edit  all the stylesheets
associated with a page”. I wish we had found it earlier, it would had made this project much easier. <br>

The following link has a small description of the tool: <br>
