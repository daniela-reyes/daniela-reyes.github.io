<h1>Week 5:</h1>
<p>Jul 12, 2015</p>

<p>The first phase of our final project was due Tuesday, July 5. I'm still enjoy this project,
at contrary to the last ones. This one gives you a lot of liberty with the design. I been going
over other groups' websites and even though they may have similar templates they are all pretty 
unique. I have to admit ours could have been better. However we did waste a lot of time trying to
understand the different tools. </p>

<p>The next phase is due this coming Tuesday, July 14. I think we are making good progress on it.
We now have a better understanding of what we are doing and what we are trying to accomplish. 
Something that we lack during the first phase, as I mention above. The only thing I dislike is 
the guideline we are given. I don't think it's clear what is required for each phase. For example 
for the first phase one of my partners wasted a whole day working with Travis and making it have
a successful build, which was listed as a requirement. However we later found out that it was actually
a mistake. I think for this phase we are going to rely more heavily in piazza. So far I seen people post
similar questions to mine, which has become useful </p>

<p>Lecture this week has been really interactive, specially last Wednesday. We had several exercises that
we had to complete in groups. I prefer this kind of participation than been call out in class. Even though 
Professor Downing is pretty calm when doing his questions. I still dislike talking in front of other people. </p>

<p>Tip-of-the-week <br> Coding Entrepreneurs have really good tutorials for django as well as bootstrap.
