<h1>Week 6:</h1>
<p>Jul 19, 2015</p>

<p>During this week Professor Downing went over SQL, which was surprisingly simple. Even though a lot of the topics in this class are straightforward I always feel that I need to at least go back and review several times to understand them a 100%. There is so much detail on Professor Downing's explanation that it is easy to miss small parts of it. So is really nice to have this kind of topics once in a while. We also had two surprise speakers from Atlassian during Wednesday lecture. Which was a nice break.</p>

<p>The quizzes for this week where also pretty simple. I got the 14 points in two of them and I just missed one question on the third one.  I have to said Friday's quiz has been my favorite so far. The questions were base on the presentation made by Atlassian on Wednesday. The easiest quiz so far. Hopefully we can get more like those know that the final presentations are soon approaching. </p>

<p>To what I understand my group is going to be presenting this upcoming Wednesday. I really don't like presenting so I'm glad we can get it out of the way on the first day. Also I will like to have some time to study for the final exam. I don't have a lot of confidence for the final, at contrary to the first one I'm not sure what to expect. </p>

<p>Tip-of-the-week: </p>
<p>For the second phase of the final project we had to embed maps,and social networks. <br>
 I found this two links useful:<br>
 
To embed Google maps:<br>
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/start<br>

To add icons that are related to whatever you are trying to embed:<br>
